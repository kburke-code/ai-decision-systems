## Designing AI Systems That Augment Exper Desision-Making

I build AI copilots and decision systems that enhance - not replace - human expertise in complex, regulated environments. 

After 25 Years leading product in high-stakes domains, I'm focused on the next evolution of enterprise software: 

**AI systems that improve judgement, reduce cognitive load, and operate safely under uncertainty.**

This portfolio documents practical prototypes, system designs, and evaluation frameworks exploring how AI can be deployed responsibily at scale.

## Current focus Areas

### Enterprise AI Copilot Architecture
- Structured decision augmentation
- Counterfactual analysis
- Confidence scoring
- Guardrail design
- Traceable reasoning

### Healthcare Workflow AI
 - AI-assisted triage systems
 - Escalation logic design
 - Risk detection patterns
 - Human-in-the-loop systems

### Healthcare Data Interoperability
- Synthetic health record simulation
- Data harmonisation logic
- Privacy-aware AI workflows

## AI System design Principles 
1. AI should propose, not decide.
2. Every system must express uncertainty.
3. Guardrails are product features, not constraints.
4. Evaluation must precede scale.
5. Transparency builds trust.
